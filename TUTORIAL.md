# Getting Started

This project provides the CLI-based application `algoid` which can be used to:

- Create and manage as many "Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)" as you wish.
- Create and manage as many Algorand wallets (standalone) as you need.
- Connect any of your wallets to any of your DIDs.
- Publish the information about any of your DIDs for global access.

## 1. Installation

To get started you first need to install the latest version of `algoid` application,
there are 3 main installation mechanisms.

### 1.1 Using a release package (recommended)

You can download and use a pre-compiled release package from the official project repository.
The latest release can be [accessed here](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/did-algo/releases/latest).
There are a number of installers availabe, choose the proper one for your local system.
Officially supported OS / Architectures include:

- macOS with Intel chips (`darwin_amd64`)
- macOS with M1 chips (`darwin_arm64`)
- Windows 32bits (`windows_386`)
- Windows 64bits (`windows_amd64`)
- Debian-based Linux distributions on 32bits (`linux_386.deb`)
- Debian-based Linux distributions on 64bits (`linux_amd64.deb`)
- RedHat-based Linux distributions on 32bits (`linux_386.rpm`)
- RedHat-based Linux distributions on 64bits (`linux_amd64.rpm`)
- Alpine-based Linux distributions on 32bits (`linux_386.apk`)
- Alpine-based Linux distributions on 64bits (`linux_amd64.apk`)

For example, to install the application version `v0.1.0` on a 64bit machine running Ubuntu
Linux you can download the `did-algo_0.1.0_linux_amd64.deb` package and perform a installation
with your package manager tools.

```shell
dpkg -i did-algo_0.1.0_linux_amd64.deb
```

Once the process is complete you should be able to use the `algoid` tool; you can
verify the installation running `version` command.

```shell
algoid version
```

### 1.2 Using the installer script

- The script requires root or sudo privileges to move `algoid` binary to `/usr/local/bin`.
- The script attempts to detect your operating system (macOS or Linux) and architecture
  (arm64, x86, amd64) to download the appropriate binary from the releases page.
- By default, the script installs the latest version of `algoid`.
- The script requires packages `curl` and `sudo` to be already installed.

```shell
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorandfoundation/did-algo/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

### 1.3 Building from source

To get the source and build the tools locally you need to:

1. If not already available, install a regular GoLang work environment following
   the [official instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2. Using git, get the source code of the official `algoid` repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/algorandfoundation/did-algo.git
```

3. Once inside the working directory containing the source code, checkout a specific
   tagged revision to build and install. For example, to use `v0.1.0`.

```shell
  git checkout v0.1.0
```

4. Build the project artifacts.

```shell
make build
```

5. Install the artifacts to your local `$GOPATH/bin` directory. This location should
   be included as part of your global `$PATH`.

```shell
make install
```

6. Once the process is complete you should be able to use the `algoid` tool; you can
   verify the installation running `version` command.

```shell
algoid version
```

## 2. Basic Usage

Once `algoid` is installed you are ready to build your Digital Identity connected
to the Algorand Blockchain. The different functions available are executed as
individual commands and subcommands like `algoid <command> <subcommand>`; you can
get detailed information of every command or subcommand using the `-h` or `--help`
flag: `algoid <command> <subcommand> --help`.

To list all the main commands available simply run `algoid` without any additional
parameters.

```txt
Algorand DID

      --home string     home directory ($HOME/.algoid)

Use "algoid [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Let's explore some of the basic functions available.

### 2.1 Configuration

To get started, created a config file at `$HOME/.algoid/config.yaml`

For example, to use Algorand testnet:

```
network:
  active: testnet
  profiles:
    # to deploy your own storage provider contract
    - name: testnet
      node: https://testnet-api.algonode.cloud
      node_token: ""
```

## 3. Wallet Management

The `algoid` application also provides all the tools you need to create and manage
any number of standalone Algorand wallets. You can explore all the functions available
by inspecting the `wallet` command.

```txt
Manage your ALGO wallet(s)

Usage:
  algoid wallet [command]

Available Commands:
  connect     Connect your ALGO wallet to a DID
  create      Create a new (standalone) ALGO wallet
  delete      Permanently delete an ALGO wallet
  disconnect  Remove a linked ALGO address from your DID
  export      Export wallet's master derivation key
  info        Get account information
  list        List your existing ALGO wallet(s)
  pay         Create and submit a new transaction
  rename      Rename an existing ALGO wallet
  restore     Restore a wallet using an existing mnemonic file
  watch       Monitor your wallet's activity
```

### 3.1 Create Wallet

Wallets are created and manage locally, the sensitive cryptographic materials
required to operate your locally wallet are encrypted prior to be written to the
local filesystem.

Let's create a new wallet, we'll use the `wallet create` command.

```shell
algoid wallet create sample-account
```

You'll be asked to enter and confirm a passphrase, this will be used as the
encryption key required for secure storage. Finally, you'll get an output similar
to this.

```shell
2024-03-06T12:00:15-05:00 INF new wallet created address=3ARALWACZXG2IHZOPYOKPHLT6KNJKI45RJSFQSYOJSJVD675DX42M4ZMRE name=sample-account
```

### 3.2 List existing Wallets

As mentioned earlier, you can create as many wallets as you wish. You can then
see a list of all your local wallets.

```shell
algoid wallet list
```

The list displays every wallet using its local alias for simpler usage.

```shell
2024-03-06T12:00:33-05:00 INF wallet found: sample-account
```

### 3.3 Get wallet details

To get additional details such as your account balance, status, rewards, etc; simply
use the `wallet info` command.

```shell
algoid wallet info sample-account
```

The client application will reach out to the network and the account information will
be printed.

```txt
address: 3ARALWACZXG2IHZOPYOKPHLT6KNJKI45RJSFQSYOJSJVD675DX42M4ZMRE
public key: d82205d802cdcda41f2e7e1ca79d73f29a95239d8a64584b0e4c9351fbfd1df9
status: Offline
round: 37804729
current balance: 0
pending rewards: 0
total rewards: 0
```

## 4. Deploy

```shell
algoid deploy sample-account

2024-03-06T12:01:40-05:00 INF storage contract deployed successfully app_id=613372790
```

### Update Config

```yml
network:
  active: testnet
  profiles:
    # to deploy your own storage provider contract
    - name: testnet
      node: https://testnet-api.algonode.cloud
      node_token: ""
      app_id: 613372790
```

## 4. DID Managent

Decentralized Identifiers are completely controlled by you, without coordination
with any central authority and can be securely used between peers on a trustless
environment via cryptographic verification. To this end, each DID instance can
include several "verification methods" and describe how each will be used in the
conext of different "verification relationships".

> For more information you can refer to the [latest specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#verification-methods).

### 4.1 Create a new DID

To create a new DID, with a new passphrase-protected cryptographic key enabled
for authentication simply run:

```shell
algoid create sample-account
```

You'll be asked to enter and confirm you passphrase and finally get an output
similar to:

```shell
2024-03-06T12:02:54-05:00 INF generating new identifier method=algo subject=d82205d802cdcda41f2e7e1ca79d73f29a95239d8a64584b0e4c9351fbfd1df9-613372790
2024-03-06T12:02:54-05:00 DBG adding master key
2024-03-06T12:02:54-05:00 DBG setting master key as authentication mechanism
2024-03-06T12:02:54-05:00 INF adding entry to local store
```

### 4.2 List existing DIDs

As mentioned earlier, you can create as many DIDs as you wish. You can then
see a list of all your identifiers.

```shell
algoid list
```

The list displays every DID instance along it's local alias for simpler usage.

```txt
Name              DID
sample-account    did:algo:d82205d802cdcda41f2e7e1ca79d73f29a95239d8a64584b0e4c9351fbfd1df9-613372790
```

### 4.3 Inspect your local DID document

Every DID is resolvable to a DID document. A DID document provides all the
information required to validate control and ownership over a given identifier.

You can inspect the all the information associated with you identifier using
the `info` command.

```shell
algoid info sample-account
```

The command will print on the screen the full contents of the associated DID
document.

```json

        "publicKeyMultibase": "zFYh9rcBz66DNU8UwzLNmyVAsLhJe17kCmFdEazHb9Qxg"
      }
    ],
    "authentication": [

    ]
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Edit a DID

The details associated with any of your identifiers can be modified using the
`edit` command. This includes adding or removing different verification methods
and/or service endpoints to disclose interaction capabilities.

```txt
Edit local DIDs

Usage:
  algoid edit [command]

Available Commands:
  key         Manage cryptographic keys associated with the DID
  service     Manage services enabled for the identifier
```

For example, to add a new cryptographic key to you identifier you can use the
`edit key add` command.

```txt
Add a new cryptographic key for the DID

Usage:
  algoid edit key add [flags]

Examples:
algoid edit key add [DID reference name] --name my-new-key --type ed --authentication

Flags:
  -a, --authentication   enable this key for authentication purposes
  -h, --help             help for add
  -n, --name string      name to be assigned to the newly added key (default "key-#")
  -t, --type string      type of cryptographic key: RSA (rsa), Ed25519 (ed) or secp256k1 (koblitz) (default "ed")
```

## 5. Publish your DID globally

Up to this point all the details about our DID are just available on our machine;
to be really useful we need to be able to publish this information on a decentralized
way so that others can retrieve it when required. To this end, the `algo` DID method
utilizes a robust integration with the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) decentralized storage
protocol.

To publish your local DID use the `publish` command.

```txt
Publish a DID instance to the processing network

Usage:
  algoid sync [flags]

Aliases:
  sync, publish, update, upload, push

Examples:
algoid sync [DID reference name]

Flags:
  -h, --help         help for sync
  -k, --key string   cryptographic key to use for the sync operation (default "master")
  -p, --pow int      set the required request ticket difficulty level (default 24)
```

For example, by running `algoid publish sample-account` you'll get an output similar to
the following.

```shell
2024-03-06T12:04:00-05:00 INF submitting request to the network
2024-03-06T12:04:00-05:00 INF publishing: sample-account
2024-03-06T12:04:00-05:00 INF publishing DID document did=did:algo:d82205d802cdcda41f2e7e1ca79d73f29a95239d8a64584b0e4c9351fbfd1df9-613372790
2024-03-06T12:04:16-05:00 INF DID instance published
```

### 5.1 Resolve a DID

Finally, other should be able to easily retrieve the DID document associated with
any particular DID instance. The `algoid` application provides the `resolve` command
for this specific purpose.

```txt
Retrieve the DID document of an existing identifier

Usage:
  algoid retrieve [flags]

Aliases:
  retrieve, get, resolve

Examples:
algoid retrieve [existing DID]
```

For example, to resolve the DID created as part of this tutorial.

```shell
algoid resolve did:algo:d82205d802cdcda41f2e7e1ca79d73f29a95239d8a64584b0e4c9351fbfd1df9-613372790
